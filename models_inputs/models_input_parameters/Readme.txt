The two S2.1 and S2.2 input parameters files contain model parameters. These change according to the sensitivity analysis case (there are 4 sens. analysis cases represented in the parameters_guide.csv). Change the parameters in the two input parameters files according to the parameters_guide.xlsx file.

DO NOT change anything inside parameters_guide.xlsx!
